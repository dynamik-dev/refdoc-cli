# Top Level

Introduction text at the top level.

### Jumped to H3

This section jumps from h1 directly to h3, skipping h2.

Some content under the h3 heading.

## Back to H2

Now we have an h2 after having an h3.

### Nested H3 Under H2

Properly nested h3 under h2.

# Another Top Level

Second top-level section.

#### Deep Jump to H4

This jumps from h1 to h4. Since h4+ are treated as body content, this heading should be included in the body text, not used as a split point.
